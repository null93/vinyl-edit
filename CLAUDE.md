# Development

- Use `make build` to build the binary
- Use `make test` to run the tests
- Use `make clean` to clean up

# Testing

- Every feature or change should include tests for both a success and failure case
- After every task that you complete, you should run `make test` to make sure your changes did not break anything

# Debugging

- Run the `token` command to debug tokens output by the lexer
- Run the `tokens --processed` command to debug tokens after processing
